    "\n",
    "Image registration is the determination of a geometrical transformation that aligns one view of an object with another view of that object or another object. The term \"view\" refers to a two-, three-dimensional image or the physical representation of an object in space. An example of two-dimensional image types may be x-ray projections captured as a digital radiograph or a light projection in a video frame. Three-dimensional images can be collected by imaging modalities commonly used in hospital settings, e.g. computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance (MR) imaging scanners. Generally, images are stored as discrete arrays of intensity values, and in medical applications, the object in each view will represent an anatomical region of interest. Explained mathematically, the inputs of registration are two views, which we map together by matching points positioned in one view to points in another view. \n",

    "### Applications of registration\n",
    "Registration may be applied to various purposes. It allows us to combine information from different sources (MR-guided radiotherapy planning) or investigate longitudinal changes in e.g. post-treatment patient monitoring. Moreover, registration procedures are employed when studying group changes across multiple subjects in a trial. Last but not least, registration can aid in segmentation tasks when mapping atlases with anatomical model priors to a newly acquired medical image, or when performing e.g. motion-induced image artefact corrections.\n",

    "### Classification of registration methods\n",
    "There is a complex categorization of registration methods in the field. The following eight categories have been proposed in relevant literature ([Fitzpatrick, J.M., et al. Image registration, section 8.1.2](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.464.5408&rep=rep1&type=pdf)): image dimensionality, registration basis, geometrical transformation, degree of interaction, optimization procedure, modalities, subject, and object. In medical applications, we typically work with individual two-dimensional slices or three-dimensional image volumes, which may be acquired sequentially over time or as a series of multiple 3D volumes (e.g. diffusion MR images). Registration may be performed via various bases, using either a location in respective views (point-based registration) or intensity similarities (intensity-based registration). Further classification of registration methods can be based on geometrical transformations, i.e. which geometrical manipulation (rigid, affine, nonlinear, etc.) are applied for alignment between two different spaces. Registration can be either automatic or semi-automatic, depending on the amount of human interaction during the registration process. The quality of registration output is estimated continuously during the procedure either as a closed-form solution or iteratively. At last, registration methods are stratified according to the amount of modalities they involve (multi-modal, intra-modal), the subjects involved in a trial (inter-subject, intra-patient, atlas-based), and commonly also the anatomical object of interest (e.g. brain, liver, etc.).\n",

    "### Causes of medical image misalignment\n",
    "\n",
    "There are various reasons for misalignments across multiple images / volumes in a series or two images acquired at different time points. In measurements where patient compliance is crucial, different patient positioning, physiological movements of organs (heartbeat, breathing, cerebrospinal fluid flow), patient motion during image acquisition, and distortions caused by imaging systems (e.g. due to the design of imaging sequences in magnetic resonance imaging) can cause data misalignment. In cases where image acquisition includes interventions (e.g. surgery, chemotherapy, biopsy), users benefit from image registration as well.\n",

    "\n",
    "In registration operations, each involved view is defined by a coordinate system. As written above, registration is the act of mapping points from space $X$ to space $Y$. A successful registration is achieved when the point $y$ in space $Y$ is approximately equal or completely correspondent to $x^{\\prime}$ after a transformation $T$ has been applied to point $x$ in $X$. In the picture below, geometrical transformation $T$ aligns the moving axial brain scan with the fixed one.\n",

Image registration, section 8.2.1](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.464.5408&rep=rep1&type=pdf)) are geometrical alignments of two objects that preserve distances, the planarity of surfaces and angles between straight lines. The so-called rigid registration problems involve object translation and rotation. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Translation \n",
    "Translation is arguably the \"simplest\" geometrical transformation that can be applied to an object. Assuming that the coordinates of a 2D geometric object are stored in the variable $X$ (the first row contains the horizontal coordinates and the second row contains the vertical coordinates), translation of the geometric object can be performed by adding a 2D translation vector $X_{t}$ to every vertex of $X$, as shown in the Python example below."

    "Nonrigid transformations ([Fitzpatrick, J.M., et al. Image registration, section 8.2.2](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.464.5408&rep=rep1&type=pdf)) are essential in registration operations for interpatient comparisons of rigid anatomies, as well as intrapatient registration of anatomical structures with artifactual distortions induced during image acquisition of nonrigid anatomies (e.g. MRI scans of beating heart). Nonrigid transformations include scaling, where the straightness of lines and the angles between them are preserved (used e.g. to suppress calibration errors in MR scanners), and affine transformations, where the angle between lines may be changed (used e.g. in deskewing a CT image after improper gantry angle recording). Further examples of nonrigid registrations comprise projective, perspective and curved registration methods (see chapters...)"
