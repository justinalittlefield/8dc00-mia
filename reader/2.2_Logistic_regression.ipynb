    "\n",
    "The logistic regression classifier can be considered as an extension of linear regression. However, logistic regression predicts whether something is True or False instead of predicting a continuous variable like height, for instance. Instead of fitting a line to the data, logistic regression fits an \"S\"-shaped curve (the sigmoid function) ranging from $0$ to $1$:\n",

    "Logistic curve thus predicts the probability of an observation being classified into certain group. Logistic regression tests if a variable's effect on the prediction is significantly different from $0$. Its ability to provide probabilities and classify new samples using continuous and discrete measurements makes it a popular machine learning approach. Logistic regression does not have the same concept of residuals unlike linear regression, i.e. the least squares method cannot be applied and the correlation $R^{2}$ cannot be calculated. Instead, the concept of maximum likelihood is used. In medical applications, logistic regression serves for mortality prediction in injured patients or as a predictor of developing a certain disease."

    "\n",
    "The loss function for logistic regression is the negative log-likelihood (NLL):\n",

    "$$\n",

The NLL loss is optimised with the gradient descent method, similar to intensity-based image registration covered in the Registration topic of this course.\n",

    "## 4. Generalization and overfitting\n",
    "\n",
    "Generalization and overfitting are crucial terms in machine learning algorithms. Generalization describes a model's ability to make accurate predictions based on new data previously absent from the training dataset. Model's generalization capability can be thought of as a success measure in making accurate predictions. However, if a model has been trained too well on training data, it will make inaccurate predictions on new data. The opposite holds as well. Underfitting can happen when a model has been trained insufficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, three datasets are used in deep learning research:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Training set** - The training set is used for training the model (i.e. iteratively updating the network weights to minimize the error).\n",
    "2. **Validation set** - At the inference phase, the validation set is used for two purposes: \n",
    "\n",
    "    - Check for model overfitting: Sometimes the model is able to 'remember' all the training examples, which means that the model will not generalize well to unseen data at the inference phase. Overfitting can be detected by inspecting the training and validation loss over time. The loss function is often based on the error between the model prediction and the desired output, this means that you want to minimize the loss function. As you can see in the figure below, the training and validation loss show the same pattern when the model is not overfitting (left figure). When the model is overfitting to the training data, you see that the training and validation loss start to diverge after a certain number of epochs (right figure), this tells you that the model is not generalizing well to new data.\n",

    "\n",
    "    - Tuning of model parameters: Many parameters (e.g. number of layers, loss function, learning rate, etc.) influence the performance of the model for a specific task. The performance can often be measured with a quantitative metric because the desired output (ground truth) is known for the validation set. By systematically adapting model parameters and evaluating the performance, the optimal parameters can be chosen.\n",
    "        \n",
    "        \n",
    "3. **Test set** - The test set is used to show the final performance of the model on an unseen set. This performance can give an indication of how the model will perform when it is implemented in for example the clinic (with the assumption that the test set resembles the real clinical data in terms of population and acquisition protocol)."
